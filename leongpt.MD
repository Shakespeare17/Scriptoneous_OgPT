// Step 1: Define the requirements
// Determine the specific functionality that you want to provide within Leon. Decide on the type of data and responses that you want from me.

// Step 2: Choose the API
// Use my RESTful API to send requests and receive responses. You can use any programming language that supports HTTP requests and JSON to communicate with my API.

// Step 3: Authenticate
// Generate an API key by signing up for an account on the OpenAI website. Use this API key to authenticate your requests to my API.

// Step 4: Set up the API endpoints
// Determine the appropriate API endpoint and HTTP method to send requests to my API. For example, to generate text, you would send a POST request to the /completions endpoint. Here's an example in Node.js:

const axios = require('axios');
const API_KEY = 'your-api-key';
const API_URL = 'https://api.openai.com/v1';

async function generateText(prompt) {
  const data = {
    prompt: prompt,
    max_tokens: 50,
    temperature: 0.5,
  };
  const headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
  };
  const response = await axios.post(`${API_URL}/completions`, data, { headers });
  return response.data.choices[0].text;
}

// Step 5: Handle responses
// Once you receive a response from my API, parse the JSON data and extract the information you need. You can then integrate this information into Leon and display it to the user.

// Step 6: Test the integration
// Test the integration thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. Debug any issues that arise and optimize the integration for performance and scalability.
